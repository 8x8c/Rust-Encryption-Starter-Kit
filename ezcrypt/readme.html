<h1>ezcrypt - A Simple Rust CLI Tool for Automatic File Encryption/Decryption</h1>

<p>
  <strong>ezcrypt</strong> is a command‐line utility that encrypts or decrypts files based on whether they
  are already encrypted or not. It uses AES‐256‐GCM for authenticated encryption, Argon2 for key derivation,
  and overwrites files atomically (to avoid corruption on unexpected termination).
</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Automatic Mode:</strong> The CLI detects whether a file is already encrypted by checking a
      <code>MAGIC_HEADER</code> (e.g., <code>ENCFILE</code>). If present, the file is decrypted; if not, 
      it is encrypted.</li>
  <li><strong>AES-256-GCM Encryption:</strong> Provides authenticated encryption and integrity checks.</li>
  <li><strong>Argon2-based Key Derivation:</strong> The file uses a random salt per file (<em>file_salt</em>)
      plus compile‐time constants (<em>STATIC_SALT</em>, <em>PEPPER</em>) to derive a unique 256‐bit key.</li>
  <li><strong>Atomic Overwrites:</strong> Data is always written to a <code>filename.tmp</code> before being 
      renamed. This helps prevent partial writes from corrupting the original file if the process is interrupted.</li>
  <li><strong>No External Paths:</strong> The tool only operates on files in the current directory
      (no subdirectories allowed).</li>
</ul>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    <strong>User Input:</strong> The app prompts the user for a file name that must reside in the current directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Check Encryption State:</strong> 
    <ul>
      <li>The tool checks the first few bytes of the file for a magic header (e.g., <code>ENCFILE</code>).</li>
      <li>If the header is found, the file is treated as encrypted; otherwise, it is assumed to be unencrypted.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Encrypt or Decrypt:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li><em>Encrypt:</em> For unencrypted files, a random 16‐byte salt is generated. The tool derives a 
      32‐byte key by combining that salt with the compile‐time pepper and static salt, hashing with Argon2, 
      and passing the result through BLAKE3. Then it generates a 12‐byte nonce, encrypts the file content 
      under AES‐256‐GCM, and writes out <code>MAGIC_HEADER | file_salt | nonce | ciphertext</code>.</li>
      <li><em>Decrypt:</em> For encrypted files, the tool parses the existing header, extracts the salt, 
      nonce, and ciphertext, re‐derives the key, and decrypts. The output is the original file data, 
      which replaces the existing file after a successful decryption.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <strong>Atomic File Overwrite:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>All writes happen into a temporary file (<code>filename.tmp</code>). Once the operation is successful 
      and flushed, it gets renamed over the original file.</li>
      <li>This prevents data corruption if the program or the system crashes mid‐operation.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Installation &amp; Usage</h2>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Install Rust (stable or later).</strong> Visit 
      <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install" target="_blank">Rust’s official site</a> for installation instructions.</li>
  <li><strong>Clone/Download this repository, then build:</strong>
    <pre><code>cd ezcrypt
cargo build --release
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Run the binary:</strong>
    <pre><code>./target/release/ezcrypt
</code></pre>
    <ul>
      <li>The tool will ask for a filename in the current directory.</li>
      <li>If the file isn’t encrypted, it will create an encrypted version, overwriting the original.</li>
      <li>If the file is encrypted (as detected by the <code>MAGIC_HEADER</code>), it will decrypt in place.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Security &amp; Caveats</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>In‐Memory Reading:</strong> Currently, the entire file contents are read into memory before 
      encryption/decryption. If you have large files, this may be an issue. Consider a streaming approach 
      if file sizes are huge.</li>
  <li><strong>Compile‐time Secrets:</strong> The <code>PEPPER</code> and <code>STATIC_SALT</code> are 
      baked into the binary. Real‐world usage would typically prompt for a password or load secrets from 
      a secure location.</li>
  <li><strong>Keys Not Stored:</strong> The derived key is ephemeral and never stored. This means that 
      if you lose your compile‐time secrets (and the salt embedded in the file), you won't be able to 
      decrypt.</li>
  <li><strong>No Subdirectory Support:</strong> This tool purposely limits files to the current working directory,
      ensuring no accidental encryption or decryption of system files outside the folder. You can remove 
      this limitation if you desire, but be cautious about the security implications.</li>
  <li><strong>Production Readiness:</strong> This is primarily a demonstration of Rust encryption techniques, 
      Argon2 key derivation, and safe atomic overwrites. For production, you’d likely expand on logging, 
      error handling, secure key management, tests, and possible hardware key storage (e.g., HSM).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Overview of Key Derivation</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Each file has its own 16‐byte <em>file_salt</em> (randomly generated).</li>
  <li>The tool also has compile‐time constants: <em>STATIC_SALT</em> and <em>PEPPER</em>.</li>
  <li>The <em>file_salt</em> is treated as the “password” in Argon2, and the combined 
      <em>STATIC_SALT + PEPPER</em> is treated as the “Argon2 salt.”</li>
  <li>Argon2 returns a hash string, which we then pass through BLAKE3 to yield a stable 32‐byte 
      key (used for AES‐256‐GCM).</li>
</ol>

<h2>Dependencies</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>aes-gcm:</strong> <code>0.10</code> - Provides AES‐GCM authenticated encryption API.</li>
  <li><strong>argon2:</strong> <code>0.4</code> - Used for key derivation.</li>
  <li><strong>blake3:</strong> <code>1.3</code> - Compresses the Argon2 hash string into a stable 32‐byte output.</li>
  <li><strong>rand:</strong> <code>0.8</code> - Generates random salts and nonces (via <code>OsRng</code>).</li>
  <li><strong>anyhow:</strong> <code>1.0</code> - Simplifies error handling by providing <code>anyhow::Error</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Example Code Snippet</h2>
<pre><code>let key = derive_key(&file_salt)?;
let cipher = Aes256Gcm::new(&key);

let nonce = Nonce::from_slice(&nonce_bytes);
let ciphertext = cipher
    .encrypt(nonce, original_data.as_ref())
    .map_err(|e| anyhow!("AES-GCM encryption failed: {e}"))?;
</code></pre>
