## A few simple encryption and keygen apps made with Rust.

Rust is an awesome lang to make simple, reliable, powerful encryption apps. Each folder here is its own app. Don't know how to code in Rust? NO PROBLEM! Just have chatgpt or similar ai code your Rust  apps for you! Weeeeeeee! :)





The prob with home-made apps is one little mistake can make any encryption script easily crackable. So before a  script/app can be trusted, it needs lots of complicated testing and auditing.  However, if you do not need the very highest encryption security, a few lines of code (any lang) can easily encrypt/decrypt files. Encryption /decryption is a simple file operation. 


Note:: For the most serious encryption, use an established, well tested app like https://github.com/str4d/rage or something. Then hit it with a round of the OTP method. As such, possible security flaws of both encryption methods would be mitigated.
