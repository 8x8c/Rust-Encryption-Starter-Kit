    <title>Why Use --force?</title>

    <h1>Why Use <code>--force</code>?</h1>
    <p>
        In many encryption tools, including this one, the <code>--force</code> option
        serves as a bypass for the tool’s built-in checks that a file is (or isn’t)
        already encrypted. Normally, these checks prevent you from accidentally
        encrypting an already-encrypted file or decrypting a file that isn’t encrypted.
    </p>

    <p>
        By default, if the tool detects that a file looks encrypted (i.e., it starts
        with the <code>MAGIC_BYTES</code> signature <code>AGCM</code>), it refuses
        to encrypt it again. Likewise, if the file <em>doesn’t</em> start with
        <code>AGCM</code>, it refuses to decrypt it. This is meant to protect users
        from corrupting their files by applying the wrong operation.
    </p>

    <h2>So, is <code>--force</code> useful?</h2>
    <p>
        In normal circumstances, you typically wouldn’t need <code>--force</code>.
        If your file is already encrypted, you can just decrypt it. If your file is
        already plaintext, you can just encrypt it. That said, the <code>--force</code>
        option can be useful in special or “edge case” scenarios:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Double encryption:</strong> You <em>could</em> use <code>--force</code>
            to encrypt a file that’s already encrypted (i.e., “encrypt it twice”).
            This is not usually recommended, as it complicates decryption; you’d have
            to decrypt once, then decrypt again. But it’s not impossible.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Files with missing or incorrect “magic bytes”:</strong> Perhaps you
            know that a file was encrypted with this tool, but for whatever reason,
            its <code>AGCM</code> signature got truncated or changed. In that case,
            the tool would refuse to decrypt it because it doesn’t <em>look</em>
            encrypted. You could <code>--force</code> it, though this may or may
            not succeed depending on what actually changed in the file.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Experimental use or partial data recovery:</strong> In rare cases
            (like data recovery scenarios), you might forcibly apply encryption or
            decryption logic to a file if you know more about its contents than the
            tool can detect automatically.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Would it “never decrypt or encrypt properly”?</h2>
    <p>
        If you use <code>--force</code> to do something unintended (like encrypting a file
        that’s already valid ciphertext), then yes, you can end up with gibberish that
        you can’t properly decrypt in one pass. In effect, you’d have a “double-encrypted”
        file. To decrypt that file, you would need to run the decryption operation twice.
    </p>

    <p>
        So, <strong>it’s not that <code>--force</code> is useless</strong>, it’s simply
        there to override safety checks when you really need to. For most users, you
        typically wouldn’t use it unless you have a special reason.
    </p>

    <hr>
    <p><em>In short, <code>--force</code> is an advanced option that disables the
    “already-encrypted/already-decrypted” check. It’s mostly there to handle
    edge cases or to deliberately override the default safety mechanism.</em></p>
